									<p>Some of the most common causes of higher-than-expected electric bills are weather-related.</p>
									<p>In hot weather, your electric bill may reflect:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Higher-than average air conditioning use.</li>
										<li>Extended use of swimming pool and spa pumps.</li>
										<li>Increased energy needed to keep refrigerators and freezers cold.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In cold weather, you may use more energy when:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Heating systems are in use more.</li>
										<li>Portable electric heaters are in use.</li>
										<li>More lighting is required for longer nights.</li>
										<li>Holiday lighting and appliances are used for entertaining.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Your electric bill may also affect by:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>More days than average in the billing period.</li>
										<li>A previous unpaid balance.</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Contact the three major credit bureaus and tell them that you believe your identity has been compromised.</li>

You may also request a “security freeze” for your file, which prevents any lenders or companies from accessing your file to open new accounts entirely.</li>
						<li>Request a copy of your credit report from each agency. Once you file a fraud alert, you may receive a free credit report upon request.</li>
						<li>Review each credit report in detail to determine if any new accounts have been opened without your consent.</li>

					<h3>Phishing and Bill Payment Scams</h3>
					<p>“Phishing” is attempting to acquire information, such as banking details, personal information, or website login information, from an individual by imitating a trusted website, telephone number, or email solicitation. In order to protect yourself against phishing attempts, please keep the following in mind:</p>
					<p class="semibold">Contacting Stream</p>
					<p>Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact Stream Energy</a> by telephone, email, or mail.</p>
					<p>Always use the correct numbers and contact information to contact Stream Energy as there are many similar web sites and toll-free 800 telephone numbers. Payments made to unauthorized, non-Stream personnel cannot be refunded and may result in identity theft.</p>
					<p class="semibold">Paying Your Bill</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stream accepts payments through online banking accounts, and with credit and debit cards.</li>
						<li>You will never be asked to pay with a pre-paid credit cards, such as Wal-Mart, CVS, or Walgreen cards.</li>
						<li>If your energy account is pending disconnection for non-payment, we will call you 2 days before the disconnection date, allowing you time to make payment arrangements with a Stream Customer Service agent. If you receive a telephone call from an individual requesting an immediate action, hang up immediately. Call the Stream Energy customer service line in the link above and ask to review your account details with an authorized Stream representative.</li>
						<li>If you receive a call from anyone claiming to be a Stream Energy representative, always ask them to verify your account information including the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number. If you are suspicious that the call is not from a Stream Energy representative, hang up immediately. Call the Stream Energy customer service line in the link above and ask to review your account details with an authorized Stream Energy representative.</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Do not respond to unsolicited (spam) email.</li>
						<li>Do not click on links contained within an unsolicited email.</li>
						<li>Be cautious of emails claiming to contain pictures in attached files; the files may contain viruses. Only open attachments from known senders. Scan the attachments for viruses if possible.</li>
						<li>Avoid filling out forms contained in email messages that ask for personal information.</li>
						<li>Always compare the link in the email to the link you are actually directed to.</li>
						<li>If you receive an email that includes a link to a business, log on to that website directly rather than clicking the link provided. If the email appears to be from your bank, credit card issuer, or other companies you deal with frequently, your statements from the business should provide the correct contact information.</li>
						<li>Contact the business that supposedly sent the email to verify that the email is genuine.</li>
						<li>If you are being pressured to act quickly or there is an emergency that requires your attention, it may be a scam.</li>
						<li>Pay attention to poor grammar, spelling, and email format as scam email typically exercise these attributes.</li>
						<li>Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</li>

					<p>At Stream Energy, we believe natural gas is an incredible resource, not to mention one of the cleanest and most abundant fossil fuels.</p>
					<p>What’s more, it produces fewer harmful emissions than power from coal. When you use natural gas, you’re using a resource that means less carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide in the environment. <span>That’s something you can feel great about!</span></p>
					<p>We’d love to talk to you about enrolling in one of our gas products today. There will be no interruption of service, and you can even bundle gas and electricity to make paying your monthly bill easier than ever.</p>
